# ARM Switch

By default, the quad / wing is always ARMED when the game window is active and you are not spectating someone else. However this can be changed by binding an ARM switch and enabling

`/set use_arm_switch 1`

Full setup with ARM switch enabled:
```
/bind aux 4 low disarm
/bind aux 4 high arm
/set use_arm_switch 1
```
